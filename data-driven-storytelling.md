If the program opens a loading screen will appear. It will disappear once all the data is loaded and all the lists are populated.
At the top of the page, you'll see two drop-down menus. The first one lets you select a directorate, and the second one lets you select a suburb. Changing these values will update the data shown on the graph and the map.

The first graph displays the top 50 counts, while the second graph shows the number of codes per directorate and suburb. Clicking on a point in the first graph will take you to the corresponding suburb on the map.

On the map, each suburb is represented by a different color. As you zoom in, the suburb layer disappears, and you'll see polylines representing the suburb, along with all the code data points. The color of the points on the map matches the color of the points in the second graph, which shows only the code data for all the data displayed under the selected directorate.
