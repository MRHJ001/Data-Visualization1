"Although I created the website in Angular, I struggled with the open-source map functionality and wasn't able to focus on the design aspect as much as I had hoped. I had originally planned to add a legend to the map that would allow users to switch layers on and off. However, due to my difficulties with the map technology and my limited time, I was unable to implement this feature. While I understand that PHP may have been a better choice, I simply didn't have enough time to learn both the map technologies and PHP and still finish the project on time."
